## Port Forwarding (Summary)

**Port Forwarding** is a method that allows the router to know **where to direct incoming traffic from outside** into your home network.  
When someone tries to connect to your external IP (for example, from your phone to your PS5), the router uses the **port number** to identify **which internal device** the data belongs to and routes it there.  
This enables remote access to devices at home (like a PS5, cameras, or a computer) in a controlled and precise way — but incorrect port forwarding configurations can expose your network to security risks.

## 🌐 VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A **VPN** creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet.  
It hides your real IP address and protects your data from being intercepted or tracked.

### ⚙️ How it works:
- Creates a secure “tunnel” between your device and the VPN server.  
- Encrypts all your internet traffic so others (including your ISP) can’t read it.  
- Allows access to blocked or geo-restricted websites.

### 🛡️ Advantages:
- Protects privacy and identity.  
- Encrypts traffic, especially on public Wi-Fi.  
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- May slow down connection speed.  
- Some VPN providers keep logs — not all are trustworthy.

**In short:**  
🔒 A VPN = safe, private, and anonymous browsing through a secure server.
