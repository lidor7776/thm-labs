## Port Forwarding (Summary)

**Port Forwarding** is a method that allows the router to know **where to direct incoming traffic from outside** into your home network.  
When someone tries to connect to your external IP (for example, from your phone to your PS5), the router uses the **port number** to identify **which internal device** the data belongs to and routes it there.  
This enables remote access to devices at home (like a PS5, cameras, or a computer) in a controlled and precise way — but incorrect port forwarding configurations can expose your network to security risks.
